Hello and welcome to my profile!

My name is Van, and I'm a full-stack developer that loves using technology to make tools relating to my interests in music, sports, and fashion.

Most of my work is done using Next.js, MobX, TailwindCSS, and Python.

🌱 I'm currently learning about cloud development, and am on the path to becoming an AWS Certified Developer
